Internship application task for Convin Internship 01/10/2021

dataO.txt is the output file, contains py script and ipynb with required code

Since we do not have Y (class or dependent variable), we can't implement nltk in our process

A simple logical function is able to provide us high accuracy for the 'Yes' class through visual inspection

After our logical function is implemented, we can't visually inspect all the output for the 'No' class since there is a large result output'

However, through visual inspection we can determine that the dataset provided is simple enough to where our logical function should provide a satisfactory enough result.
